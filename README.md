# Levels


- HUGE, Automated defences and giant mech bots
- Snow fields Opening level
- Pyramids



## Ideas Experimental 

- AI team formations
- Kill Enemy boss spawns for money
- Dead players respawn back at base, with 10 countdown after spawn
- Big gaps between def, mid and attack (you can flick between characters)
- Lock 3 balls to blow up the enemy fortress...then final push to take them out

- Switch players to distract boss focus

Players run in to the center in a V formation to clash and start shooting after 3.2.1...
